# parking-control

Sample project to simulate a system that manages allocations of parking spots in a townhouse.

The original project is from https://github.com/MichelliBrito/parking-control-api, and was clonned and refactored for didatic purposes, being the first purpose to adapt it 
to a hexagonal architecture structure based on project https://github.com/MichelliBrito/ms-email/tree/hexagonal-architecture.
